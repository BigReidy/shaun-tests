# Coding tests curated by Shaun.

## Guidelines
1. Use VSCode - not because it's better or anything, just because it's consistent
1. Clone the repo, and commit your submission to your clone.
1. Make the repo public, or add me as a collaborator [how-to](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)
1. Take as long as you need, rarely is rushed code good code.
